# Benchmark Lab and Results

This document describes the reproducible benchmark environment for honk, the
measurement methodology, and the most recent results against
[dae](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae) (same-time A/B). It lives in the
repo so the setup and the numbers stay in sync with the code.

```

- **Engine host (10.10.10.57)**: runs either honk or dae (never both). The
  client lives in network namespace `lab` (veth pair `veth-lab` ↔
  `veth-client`, 192.168.222.0/24, NAT via nftables masquerade). All client
  traffic crosses the engine's real eBPF datapath, so numbers include the
  full kernel path, not a loopback shortcut.
- **Server host (10.10.10.70)**: protocol servers (official hysteria,
  tuic-server, sing-box, Go anytls-server) plus local targets. Servers dial
  out to the internet directly, so "internet" tests traverse server → WAN.
- **Isolation**: nothing here touches the production gateway (10.10.10.1).
  Production validations are done separately and called out as such.

### Known lab limits

- Both VMs have single-queue virtio NICs. VM↔VM throughput caps around
  0.8–1.7 Gbps TX; physical↔VM reaches 9.4 Gbps. For bandwidth runs the
  servers therefore live on the **physical** host: client RX (9.4 Gbps) is
  the ceiling, not the inter-VM link. Direct baseline (engine direct path +
  NAT): **~9.4 Gbps**.
- **Engine VM CPU is host-passthrough (i5-13600K, AES-NI + AVX2)**. It
  used to be qemu64 with no SIMD — all QUIC crypto was software (honk's
  BoringSSL fell back to its `nohw` C ChaCha20-Poly1305, 34% of engine
  CPU), and QUIC bandwidth capped ~2–2.4 Gbps for both engines. With
  AES-NI the numbers below are crypto-representative of production
  hardware.
- Run-to-run variance on shared infrastructure is ±5%; stall-type artifacts
  on WAN subscriptions fluctuate on multi-minute windows and are not engine
  regressions — see "Production notes" below.
- The lab is shared with other test work. If a row looks off, re-run it
  before publishing (an engine restarted mid-run by someone else corrupts
  measurements).

## What's running where

| Component | Binary | Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hy2 server | official `hysteria` | `:8443`, password `testpass123`, cert CN `hy2.test` |
| TUIC server | `tuic-server` 1.0.0 | `:2444`, uuid `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` / `testpass123`, requires SNI `hy2.test` |
| AnyTLS server | sing-box | `:2445`, password `testpass123` |
| AnyTLS server | Go reference `anytls-server` | `:2443`, `-p testpass123` |
| SS 2022 server | sing-box | `:2447`, `2022-blake3-aes-128-gcm`, psk `8JCsHssyVTFyPy5lYdNhZg==` |
| Trojan server | sing-box | `:2446`, password `testpass123`, SNI `hy2.test` |
| Targets | python http.server, iperf3 | ports `8001-8006` + `8080` (direct), `5201-5206` + `5300` (direct); UDP echo `:53530` |

Engine configs route by destination port so no API switching is needed:
`5201/8001 → hy2`, `5202/8002 → tuic`, `5203/8003 → ss2022`,
`5204/8004 → trojan`, `5205/8005 → anytls-sb`, `5206/8006 → anytls-go`
(honk only — dae has no AnyTLS). Node server ports are `direct(must)`,
everything else falls back to direct.

## Methodology

One harness — `bench/lab-bench.sh` (in this repo, run on the engine host) —
replaces the old bench.sh/bench-cold.sh/bench-cpu.sh/bench-honest.sh set.
See `bench/README.md` for usage and lab requirements.

Per engine × protocol:

- **cold** — first-request latency on a freshly restarted engine, 3 runs,
  median. Health checks are at 3600s in both lab configs so the first probe
  doesn't race the measurement.
- **hot p50/p95** — open-stream latency over 15 requests against the
  per-protocol HTTP target (proxy session already warm). For QUIC protocols
  this is dominated by connection/session reuse; for mux protocols by the
  pooled session.
- **bw** — iperf3 `-R` download, single stream, 3 runs, median receiver
  bitrate.
- **udp** — per protocol: echo RTT (15 pings to the routed echo port
  5353x, median) and iperf3 `-u -b 10G -l 1200 -R` (receiver bitrate +
  loss at a saturating offered rate; datagrams pinned to 1200 B because
  QUIC datagrams cap near that).
- **cpu** — engine CPU cores during the median bandwidth run
  (`/proc/<pid>/stat` utime+stime delta over wall time). The honk pid is
  anchored on the clash-API listener so a second instance parked on the
  singleton flock (zero CPU) can't poison the metric.
- **rss** — engine RSS after the bandwidth runs.
- **direct baseline** — same measurements on the unproxied path
  (`8080`/`5300`).

```bash
scp bench/lab-bench.sh root@10.10.10.57:/root/
ssh root@10.10.10.57 "bash /root/lab-bench.sh 'honk dae' 'hy2 tuic ss2022 trojan anytls-sb anytls-go'"

```

### VLESS Vision codec candidate benchmark

`crates/honk-outbound/benches/vless_vision.rs` isolates response decoding on a
clear loopback carrier; production Vision remains TLS/REALITY-only. Both cases
decode exactly **16 MiB** from deterministic 16 KiB source writes, and each
binary validates the decoded byte count before Criterion starts timing:

- `vision_framed_16m`: many content/padding frames ending with `End`;
- `vision_direct_16m`: one `Direct` frame followed by the raw tail.

The paired release-musl binaries run on the confirmed x86-64 Debian host
`root@10.10.10.50`, from one Criterion directory and back-to-back:

```bash
ssh root@10.10.10.50 \
  'mkdir -p /root/vless-vision-criterion && cd /root/vless-vision-criterion && \
   /root/vless-vision-bench.before --bench --save-baseline vless-before-final'
ssh root@10.10.10.50 \
  'cd /root/vless-vision-criterion && \
   /root/vless-vision-bench.after --bench --baseline vless-before-final'
```

Accept a candidate only when the framed point estimate improves and its 95%
interval excludes a slowdown greater than 3%; the Direct point estimate may
regress by at most 3%.

## Results (2026-08-06, UDP post-decision offload verification @ NanoPi R2S)

Verifies the QUIC UDP offload (drop-and-reinject rebuild,
`HONK_UDP_POST_DECISION_OFFLOAD=1`). The standard UDP rows (iperf3/echo
through proxy groups) are unaffected by design — matching the previous round
line by line (within noise) is the correct outcome. A supplementary QUIC-type
direct-UDP load (juicity tunnel through `domain(suffix:hy2.test)->direct`,
domain++):

| Load | offload ON | offload OFF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QUIC direct UDP (juicity) | **149.1 Mbps @ 0.00 cores** (endpoint hits=0) | 33.2 Mbps @ 0.78 cores (hits=13588) |

4.5× throughput with the engine CPU at zero (the 149 Mbps ceiling is the
juicity client's own QUIC crypto on the A53). The direct row holds at
874 Mbps @ 0.00 cores (dae 889, on par); TCP protocol rows within ≤2.3% — no
regression.

## Results (2026-08-06, direct kernel-offload verification @ NanoPi R2S)

Verifies PR #17 (kernel offload of direct-routed flows in Rule mode, per-flow
cached decision, zero per-packet cost). Engine is feat/rprx (incl. main
`ac5ffbb`) aarch64-musl; the lab's 8080/5300 targets route via
`fallback: direct` (non-must) — exactly the path this feature targets. Two
alternating rounds; dae re-measured in the same window.

| Engine | Protocol | cold | bw (Mbps) | cpu | RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| honk | direct (with offload) | 0.0043 | **880** (prev 370) | **0.01** (prev 0.71) | 61 |
| dae | direct | 0.0041 | 896 | 0.01 | 39 |

All protocol rows within noise of the previous round (hy2 267/268, tuic
260/262, ss2022 353/353, trojan 279/282) — no regression. honk direct now
matches dae (the 1.8% gap is link noise); cold improved too (6.2→4.3ms, on
par with dae's 4.1ms).

## Results (2026-08-05, ARM A/B: honk vs dae @ NanoPi R2S)

Two-engine comparison on the NanoPi R2S (two runs: .43 onboard NIC, then a
.45 re-run over a USB NIC); honk is feat/rprx `2ad0a93` aarch64-musl, dae is
kdae `ae056a6a` (go1.26.5). Methodology unchanged; only one engine runs at a
time. dae only supports the shared protocol rows (hy2/tuic/ss2022/trojan).
Values are means of two alternating rounds, <5% intra-round deviation.
**The .45 re-run used a USB NIC, shifting absolute bandwidth down ~10–15% —
compare ratios, not absolutes.**

### TCP (.45 re-run values; `→` shows the .43 first round)

| Engine | Protocol | cold | hot p50 | bw (Mbps) | cpu | RSS (MB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### UDP (.45 re-run; echo RTT s / saturated receive Mbps / cpu)

| Engine | Protocol | RTT | bw | cpu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| honk | hy2/udp | 0.0029 | 33 | 1.85 |
| dae | hy2/udp | 0.0034 | 31 | 2.14 |
| honk | tuic/udp | 0.0028 | 53 | 1.76 |
| dae | tuic/udp | 0.0034 | 33 | 2.21 |
| honk | ss2022/udp | 0.0021 | 34 (73.8%) | 0.93 |
| dae | ss2022/udp | 0.0027 | 40 (87.9%) | 1.29 |
| honk | trojan/udp | 0.0019 | 31 | 0.88 |
| dae | trojan/udp | 0.0031 | 49 | 1.45 |

Read-out:

- **honk leads TCP throughput by 35–65%, reproducibly**: hy2 1.40×, tuic
  1.34×, trojan 1.65×, ss2022 1.43× (ratio drift vs the .43 round ≤0.1); CPU
  cost per Mbps is about half of dae's (hy2: 1.34 cores@268 vs 1.86@191). On
  A53 little cores the Go runtime's per-byte cost is amplified most on QUIC.
- **Latency**: dae's tuic hot p50 83ms / cold 104ms (per-connection QUIC
  session rebuild) reproduces exactly; honk stays ≤8ms hot p50 across all
  protocols. honk's UDP echo RTT is consistently 0.5–1.2ms lower per row.
- **The direct-row gap is path, not engine**: dae offloads fallback-direct
  fully in eBPF (895Mbps@0.01 cores); honk only offloads must-marked direct
  and relays fallback-direct in userspace (370@0.71) — a candidate honk
  optimization.
- **UDP** hits the A53 platform ceiling for both engines (30–57 Mbps); memory
  slightly favors dae (38–59 vs 48–61MB), neither is a constraint at 1GB.
- Fairness: both engines relay TCP in userspace (dae log confirms eBPF
  offload disabled).

## Results (2026-08-05, ARM round: NanoPi R2S / RK3328)

Engine host 10.10.10.43 (NanoPi R2S: 4×Cortex-A53 @1.3GHz, 968MB RAM, end0
1Gbps, kernel 6.18, cpuinfo shows `aes pmull sha1 sha2`), running a feat/rprx
`2ad0a93` aarch64-musl build. Methodology unchanged (netns lab → real eBPF
datapath → .70). **Line-rate anchor: with the engine off, the same netns+NAT
path saturates 941 Mbps**, so every number below is bounded by the userspace
engine. The cpu column counts only honk's utime/stime (no softirq).

### TCP

### UDP (hot, `udp_warm_node_count: 8`)

| Protocol | echo RTT p50 | bw Mbps (loss) | cpu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hy2 | 2.77 ms | 34 (97.8%) | 1.91 |
| tuic | 2.88 ms | 46 (98.1%) | 1.86 |
| ss2022 | 2.09 ms | 42 (91.0%) | 0.92 |
| trojan | 2.12 ms | 38 (98.1%) | 0.90 |
| anytls-sb | 2.23 ms | 50 (89.3%) | 1.79 |
| anytls-go | 2.54 ms | 57 (87.7%) | 1.80 |

Read-out (A53 little cores vs x86 E-13600K, same methodology as 08-04):

- **Everything is CPU-bound**: direct 437 (vs 9390 on x86); TCP protocols
  flatten at 330–390 Mbps (flat across rows = the shared relay+crypto path is
  the bottleneck, not any single handler); QUIC per-core efficiency is ~20×
  lower. vmess at 416 is closest to the direct baseline, confirming `5dc47cf`'s
  BoringSSL AEAD pays off equally under ARM crypto extensions; its 1.50 cores
  remain the highest among TCP rows (a cross-platform optimization target).
  vless-vision at 183 is the lowest TCP row; the vision/reality hot p50 of
  ~18ms (vs 3.3ms on x86) is the REALITY handshake cost on slow crypto.
- **UDP suffers most**: 34–57 Mbps with 88–98% loss — the per-packet path
  (TPROXY recvmsg provenance + anyfrom replies + tunnel framing) saturates the
  little cores; echo RTT is an order of magnitude slower than x86.
- **RSS 47–61MB matches x86 exactly**; a 1GB device shows zero memory
  pressure — the constraint is purely CPU.
- The .70 rprx target services (8007-8009/5207-5209/53537-53539) were
  half-broken this round; those three rows used an equivalent variant (working
  targets 8001/5201 re-routed to the respective groups) with unchanged
  methodology.

## Results (2026-08-05, rprx family: VLESS+REALITY(±vision)/VMess join the matrix)

Covers the protocol rows added by feat/rprx (PR #12); engine is a feat/rprx
musl+mimalloc build (vless rows measured on `67b5a56`, the vmess row on a
rebuild with the `5dc47cf` AEAD fix). Methodology identical to the rounds
above. New server matrix on 10.10.10.70 (sing-box 1.13.14):
vless+reality+vision `:2448`, vless+reality `:2449`, vmess bare tcp `:2450`;
targets http `8007-8009`, iperf3 `5207-5209`, udp echo `53537-53539`; engine
routes by port (`5207/8007/53537→vision`, `…8→reality`, `…9→vmess`). The
REALITY dest is a local TLS service (note: the dest's TLS Certificate message
must fit the server's 8 KiB capture buffer or auth fails).

Calibration anchors (this round vs 08-04): direct 9411/9390, ss2022
9399/9398, anytls-sb 9406/9388 Mbps — environment consistent, so the table
below compares directly against the 08-04 rows.

| Engine | Protocol | cold | hot p50 | hot p95 | bw (Mbps) | cpu | RSS (MB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| honk | vless-reality-vision | 0.0037 | 0.0033 | 0.0050 | 9372 | 0.60 | 45 |
| honk | vless-reality | 0.0043 | 0.0034 | 0.0042 | 9383 | 0.49 | 54 |
| honk | vmess (tcp) | 0.0022 | 0.0010 | 0.0014 | 9313 | 0.78 | 50 |

- All three rows sit at line rate (~9.4G). The vmess row is post-`5dc47cf`
  (body AEAD moved from RustCrypto to BoringSSL); before the fix the same
  path measured ~420 MB/s handler-level (single core at 105%). vmess cpu
  (0.78) is still the highest of the TCP protocols (per-chunk SHAKE size
  masking + framing) — a follow-up optimization candidate.
- vision vs non-vision shows no bandwidth difference (BoringSSL AES-NI is
  already line-rate below 10G); the vision row pays slightly more cpu
  (0.60 vs 0.49) for framing, and its cold includes the REALITY handshake.
- vless/vmess have no UDP datapath in honk (README TODO); the UDP rows are
  empty by design, not a measurement failure.

## Results (2026-08-04, honk outbound-v2 refactor regression check)

Single-engine regression round for the outbound-v2 refactor merge — no
dae/sing-box arms; the 08-02 round (`49b166d`) is the comparison baseline.
Engine host 10.10.10.59, server host 10.10.10.70, methodology unchanged.

- honk: main `d00cb5e` (musl, mimalloc) — the outbound-v2 refactor (protocol
  surface cut to Direct/Block/SOCKS5/SS2022/Trojan/VMess/VLess/AnyTLS/
  Hysteria2/TUIC/Juicity; `ProtocolDescriptor` capability table; capability
  traits replace the fat `ProxyHandler`; content-derived stable NodeId;
  generation-owned QUIC clients with cross-reload runtime reuse; TCP dial
  path pinned to the admission generation; per-generation dial budget) plus
  the AnyTLS overflow fix below.

**This round caught a real regression on main.** `85d6b61` (bound
slow-consumer overflow, shipped in v0.0.1.beta.33/34) reset an AnyTLS stream
the instant its 2 MiB overflow cap was crossed — but a fast LAN peer bursts
past that in ~4 ms, before the reader task is first scheduled, so
single-stream iperf3 read 2–3 Mbps on both the pre-refactor binary
(`8a32149`) and the refactored one (bisected: parent `c7cbd67` is good at
8.8 Gbps). The fix (`caa95b0` + `d00cb5e`) restores progress-based
semantics: the per-stream byte cap is soft within a 3 s no-flush-progress
grace — parked bytes are not a stall; at a session-wide cap the demux waits
in 500 ms rounds for reader progress (pausing reads backpressures the
server through the TCP window) and a timed-out round resets only the
most-stalled parked stream. Lab-verified: anytls-sb 9388 / anytls-go 9396
Mbps, zero overflow kills, relay counters confirm the tunnel path.

¹ The direct row first read 6841 on a loaded lab window; three immediate
re-runs read 9388/9389/9390.
² TUIC UDP collapsed for every engine this round — the .70→.59 UDP link
was near saturation (same lab-condition artifact as the 08-02 round), not
an engine regression.

### Reading the 08-04 results

- **No regression from the refactor**: against the same-day pre-refactor
  arm (`8a32149`) every non-AnyTLS row matches within lab variance (hy2
  6156 vs 5966, tuic 5293 vs 5546, ss2022/trojan line rate both ways). The
  higher readings vs the 08-02 round (hy2 2858, tuic 4134) reflect an idle
  lab, not a refactor speedup — the QUIC data path is unchanged code.
- **AnyTLS is the big win**: the stall-grace fix takes anytls-sb from the
  4575 pre-regression baseline to 9388 (line rate) and anytls-go to 9396 —
  the demux-backpressure design also removes the overflow churn the old
  park-based path produced under fast peers. The pre-refactor binary
  measured 2–3 Mbps on both rows (bug present).
- TUIC UDP remains the known weak spot (lab link caveat above).

## Results (2026-08-02, three-engine: honk vs dae vs sing-box)

The engine host for this round was **10.10.10.59** (another VM in the same lab;
the server host is still the physical 10.10.10.70; the production gateway
10.10.10.1 carries a `sip(10.10.10.59/32) -> direct(must)` rule so benchmark
traffic bypasses its proxy datapath). Topology and methodology are unchanged
from the 08-01 round.

- honk: main `49b166d` (musl, mimalloc) — includes the eBPF datapath admission
  gate, per-network LoadBalance/Fallback state, lazy AnyTLS TLS connectors, the
  tracing-stack silencing fix, the dial-failure penalty sample, TPROXY listener
  marking, and the halving moving average for URLTest.
- dae: kdae `ae056a6a` (Go 1.26.0; updated from the 08-01 round's `eee7c88b`,
  includes outbound-fork fixes).
- sing-box: v1.13.14 (TUN client inside lab netns, port-route per protocol).

### UDP: warmed steady-state comparison (08-02)

Same methodology as the 08-01 steady round: after each engine starts, wait 30s
for health-check convergence, run 5 TCP warm-up requests per protocol, settle
10s, then measure. `iperf3 -u -b 10G -l 1200 -R` single flow and `-P 8`
aggregate.

| engine | protocol | echo RTT (ms) | single Mbps (loss) | P8 aggregate Mbps (loss) |

| dae | hy2 | 0.36 | 938 (85.6%) | 864 (97.6%) |
| sing-box | hy2 | 0.42 | 1607 (74.4%) | 1588 (95.7%) |
| honk | tuic | 0.11 | 359 (67.1%) | FAIL |
| dae | tuic | 0.11 | 325 (75.1%) | 1 (27.3%) |
| sing-box | tuic | 0.14 | 101 (74.2%) | FAIL |

| dae | ss2022 | 0.21 | 2448 (55.6%) | 2382 (89.8%) |
| sing-box | ss2022 | 0.19 | 2475 (56.5%) | 2944 (87.9%) |
| honk | trojan | 0.06 | 1623 (72.0%) | 3159 (91.8%) |
| dae | trojan | 0.13 | 2864 (49.6%) | 2631 (92.3%) |
| sing-box | trojan | 0.09 | 3226 (42.7%) | 4092 (88.9%) |
| honk | anytls-sb | 0.69 | 1294 (78.5%) | 1266 (96.5%) |
| dae | anytls-sb | 0.15 | 1278 (78.8%) | 2610 (91.1%) |
| sing-box | anytls-sb | 0.67 | 1268 (79.1%) | 2760 (90.7%) |
| honk | anytls-go | 0.12 | 1484 (76.5%) | 1269 (96.5%) |
| dae | anytls-go | 0.21 | 1435 (76.9%) | 2259 (93.2%) |
| sing-box | anytls-go | 0.98 | 1375 (77.8%) | 2248 (93.1%) |

Note: the first steady-state run was measured **without** `udp_warm_node_count`
(honk's UDP warm-up knob; the production config sets it to 8). After enabling
`udp_warm_node_count: 8`, honk's rows re-measured as follows (dae and sing-box
have no such knob; their rows are unchanged):

| engine | protocol | single Mbps (loss) | P8 aggregate Mbps (loss) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| honk (udp_warm) | hy2 | 1622 (74.1%) | 1650 (95.5%) |
| honk (udp_warm) | tuic | **1252 (72.3%)** | FAIL |
| honk (udp_warm) | ss2022 | 1796 (68.7%) | 2916 (88.0%) |
| honk (udp_warm) | trojan | 1562 (73.2%) | 3283 (91.3%) |
| honk (udp_warm) | anytls-sb | 1254 (79.9%) | 1297 (96.2%) |
| honk (udp_warm) | anytls-go | 1400 (77.4%) | 1298 (96.3%) |

tuic single-flow improved from 359 to 1252 Mbps — cold session establishment
was indeed the dominant cost in the un-warmed measurement; the other rows are
within noise. The anytls P8 shortfall and the tuic P8 failure are unrelated to
warm-up and stand as genuine weaknesses.

**Reading the steady-state UDP results (08-02):**

- **hy2**: honk 1663 ≈ sing-box 1607 > dae 938; P8 does not scale for any
  engine (0.9–1.6 Gbps at 96%+ loss), far from honk's 5.91 Gbps single-flow in
  the 08-01 steady round — see the lab-condition note below.
- **TUIC UDP collapsed across all three engines** (101–359 Mbps): the direct
  UDP baseline measured in the same round (port 5300, no proxy) reached only
  1954 Mbps at 61% loss, so the .70→.59 UDP link itself was near its
  saturation ceiling. Absolute tuic figures are therefore not comparable with
  the 08-01 steady round (6.18 Gbps); this is a lab-condition artifact and the
  row should be re-measured on an idle link.
- **ss2022**: single-flow sing-box 2475 ≈ dae 2448 > honk 1851; P8 honk 2928 ≈
  sing-box 2944 > dae 2382. honk still trails single-flow but has caught up
  on P8.
- **trojan**: single-flow sing-box 3226 > dae 2864 > honk 1623; P8 sing-box
  4092 > honk 3159 > dae 2631. honk's trojan UDP-over-TCP single-flow remains
  the lowest of the three and the top UDP optimization target.
- **anytls UoT**: single-flow is tied (~1.3–1.5 Gbps); **P8 is clearly lowest
  for honk** (1266/1269 vs dae 2610/2259 vs sing-box 2760/2248) — a newly
  exposed multi-flow UDP weakness worth a dedicated analysis.

### Reading the 08-02 results

- **Latency**: honk best across the board — cold 5–11ms (dae tuic still pays a
  full QUIC handshake per connection at 86ms; sing-box 8–13ms), hot p50
  2.3–4.7ms.
- **TCP bandwidth**: line-rate rows (ss2022, trojan, anytls-go) are tied at
  ~8.7–9.4 Gbps. QUIC protocols go to honk: hy2 2858 (+3.7% vs dae, +11% vs
  sing-box), tuic 4134 (+41% / +58%). Versus the 08-01 round, dae's hy2/tuic
  bandwidth fell from 4467/4537 to 2757/2940 while honk's hy2 recovered to the
  same tier.
- **UDP**: honk leads the QUIC protocols by a wide margin — hy2 1743 (vs
  931/1561), tuic 1577 (vs 108/27; dae's and sing-box's TUIC UDP was nearly
  unusable this round). **The weak spot is still UDP-over-TCP**: ss2022 1207 vs
  2367/2509, trojan 1629 vs 2903/3330 — about half of the competitors, and still
  the top UDP optimization target. anytls-sb/go are tied (~1.3–1.5 Gbps).
- **CPU**: honk lowest on most rows (ss2022 0.39 vs 0.51/1.30 cores; hy2 0.49
  vs 0.82/0.87; tuic 0.59 vs 0.82/0.89).
- **RSS**: comparable across engines (47–62 MB).

## Results (2026-08-01, three-engine: honk vs dae vs sing-box)

honk: dev `ed640c7` (musl, mimalloc, reuseport-2 merge, single UDP listener per family).
dae: kdae branch, Go 1.26.0.
sing-box: v1.13.14 (TUN client inside lab netns, port-route per protocol).
All measured same-time on the lab. Latencies in seconds, TCP bandwidth is the
iperf3 receiver median, CPU in cores, RSS after the run. sing-box CPU is not
measured (TUN-client model does not expose per-protocol process CPU).

### Reading the three-engine table

**TCP bandwidth:**
- Line-rate protocols (ss2022, trojan, anytls-go): all three engines reach
  ~8.7–9.4 Gbps. honk and dae are within noise of each other; sing-box
  trails slightly (8717 vs 9405 on ss2022, 8823 vs 9249 on anytls-go).
- QUIC protocols (hy2, tuic): dae leads at 4467/4537 Mbps. honk is at
  3050/4400, sing-box at 2998/2620. honk has a hy2 regression vs the
  previous 07-30 run (5239→3050), likely due to lab host load.
- anytls-sb: sing-box leads at 8244, dae 5586, honk 4792. This is the
  sing-box reference implementation; honk's anytls handler trails by ~40%.

**CPU efficiency:**
- On every QUIC row where both are measured, honk uses ~50% less CPU than
  dae at comparable bandwidth (hy2: 0.50 vs 1.07, tuic: 0.60 vs 0.98).
- On TCP-based protocols honk is consistently 0.3–0.5 cores lower than dae.

**Latency:**
- dae's tuic still pays a full QUIC handshake per connection (cold 85 ms vs
  honk's 5 ms with ticket-cache resume).
- sing-box cold latencies are highest across the board (TUN + userspace
  routing adds ~10–35 ms overhead).
- Hot latencies are all single-digit ms for all three engines.

**UDP (cold engine, single flow):**
- This run was on a cold engine (health checks unconverged, sessions cold),
  so UDP numbers read 3–5× lower than steady-state. See the warm-state
  comparison below.
- TUIC UDP cold-start is broken on all three engines (11–100 Mbps), but
  honk reaches 6.18 Gbps single-flow once warm — the cold numbers are a
  session-setup artifact, not a protocol limitation.

### UDP: warm-state three-engine comparison

All three engines were started, allowed 30s for health checks to converge,
then TCP sessions were primed through every protocol. UDP was measured
after a further 10s settle. Single flow and 8-flow aggregate
(`iperf3 -u -b 10G -l 1200 -R` / `-P 8`). Datagrams pinned to 1200 B.

† honk hy2 P8 failed on this run (iperf3 returned 0); earlier warm-UDP
runs recorded 9.18 Gbps at 3.1% loss. Re-run on idle lab to confirm.

### Reading the warm UDP table

**Honk dominates warm-state UDP across every protocol:**
- Single flow: 5.5–6.4 Gbps with 0.06–13.6% loss. dae and sing-box are at
  0.9–3.5 Gbps with 40–86% loss — honk is **2–6× faster at 5–15× lower
  loss**.
- P8 aggregate: honk reaches 8.7–9.4 Gbps (near line rate) at 0.8–7.8%
  loss. dae and sing-box collapse on P8 with 88–98% loss — their UDP
  datapaths cannot handle 8 parallel saturating flows.
- **TUIC UDP** goes from 11 Mbps cold to **6.18 Gbps warm** (560×
  improvement). The protocol itself works; the cold-start numbers were a
  session-setup artifact, not a protocol limitation.
- **Trojan UDP** at 6.31 Gbps / 0.06% loss is nearly lossless — honk's
  UDP-over-TCP framing has no measurable overhead at line rate.
- **anytls-go** at 6.44 Gbps / 0.4% loss single-flow and 9.37 Gbps / 1.1%
  P8 is the best all-around UDP performer.

**dae and sing-box UDP collapse on P8 is not a lab artifact:**
Both engines show the same pattern — single-flow at 1–3.5 Gbps with
moderate loss, then P8 at same or LOWER throughput with 88–98% loss. This
indicates a fundamental bottleneck in their UDP receive paths (shared
socket buffer contention, lack of per-flow queuing, or kernel-level UDP
socket lock contention) that honk's `UdpEndpointPool` and per-flow bounded
queues were specifically designed to avoid.

## Results (2026-07-31, honk dev `ac64fe1` vs dae kdae `eee7c88b`)

Same-time A/B on the lab. honk is the musl release binary (mimalloc,
periodic `mi_collect` on a blocking thread, idle drain deadline); dae is
the kdae branch at `eee7c88b` (adds a DNS group-override fix and bumps the
outbound fork to `perf/complete-optimizations@670df833`). Latencies in
seconds, bandwidth is the iperf3 receiver median, CPU in cores, RSS after
the run. New in this run: **the kdae direct baseline works** (it was
broken in the 07-30 run).

### Reading the 07-31 table

- **TCP bandwidth** is parity within noise: line-rate rows (direct,
  ss2022, trojan, anytls-go) all ~9.3–9.4 Gbps both engines; anytls-sb is
  now a tie too (4790 vs 4742 — the new kdae no longer dominates that
  row). hy2/tuic slightly favor dae (3005/4280 vs 2921/3961).
- **CPU per Gbps** still belongs to honk on every QUIC row: hy2 0.48 vs
  0.82 cores, tuic 0.55 vs 0.93, and trojan 0.45 vs 0.65 at identical
  bandwidth.
- **Latency**: dae's tuic still pays a full QUIC handshake per connection
  (cold 82.7 ms, hot p50 79.2 ms vs honk's 9.3/3.4 ms, ticket-cache
  resumed). Everything else is single-digit ms both ways.
- **UDP**: honk leads hy2 (1708 vs 929) and anytls-go; the ss2022/trojan
  UDP-over-TCP gap persists (dae 2705/2972 vs honk 1879/1609) and remains
  the top UDP optimization target. TUIC UDP is broken-ish on both engines
  (142/60 Mbps).
- honk's hy2/tuic TCP bandwidth dropped vs the 07-30 run (5239→2921,
  5351→3961) while dae's stayed flat; the .70 lab host was under heavy
  parallel load during this run, so treat these two rows as suspect until
  re-measured on an idle lab.

The dae rows are the **kdae branch build** (`2a007b39`,
`unstable-20260729.r987`), built from `../dae` on the bench host — the
first dae build with AnyTLS support. The sing-box rows are **1.13.14**
running as a TUN client *inside* the lab netns (`bench/sb-client.json`
deployed to the engine host; per-port route rules mirror the engine
configs, outbounds bound to `veth-client`).

¹ honk's anytls rows carry a history: single-stream iperf3 used to read
2–3 Mbps here. The cause was honk's own — a full per-stream demux queue
(64 frames) triggered an *instant* stream kill, which fired 22 ms into a
single-stream run when the server's initial flight outran the fresh
relay task; the server then flooded the pooled session with PSH frames
for the dead sid. The measured rows above used the first bounded-HOL fix,
which parked for up to 5 s before killing. The current path is nonblocking:
per-stream buckets have 512-frame / 2 MiB-stream / 8 MiB-session hard caps,
and cap pressure immediately resets only the offender after admitted bytes
drain. anytls-go matches dae in the historical run; anytls-sb trails (the
sing-box server emits patterns dae tolerates better — future work).

² dae's direct path is broken on this lab kernel (kdae build): direct
flows time out while proxied flows work. All dae protocol rows above are
valid; there is no dae direct baseline.

### UDP results (iperf3 `-u -b 10G -l 1200 -R`, echo RTT)

Same A/B run. Offered rate is a fixed 10 Gbps — far above what any tunnel
carries, so the loss column reflects saturation, not quality; the
receiver bandwidth is the capacity number. Datagram length is pinned to
1200 B: QUIC datagrams cap near that (honk hy2/tuic drop oversized
datagrams — iperf3's path-MTU default ~1448 B would measure the cap, not
the tunnel). Echo RTT is the median of 15 pings through the per-protocol
routed echo port (53531–53536).

| engine | protocol | echo RTT p50 | bw Mbps (loss) | cpu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| honk | hy2 | 0.37 ms | 1738 (73.1%) | 1.30 |

- **hy2 UDP**: honk leads (1738 vs 932 / 1372) at ~1 core per engine.
- **TUIC UDP** is weak across all three engines (293 / 9 / 16 Mbps) —
  QUIC-datagram TUIC is a protocol-level weak spot in this lab, honk is
  least-bad.
- **UDP-over-TCP tunnels** (ss2022, trojan): dae/sing-box lead
  (2.7–3.4 Gbps vs honk 1.1–1.5). honk's UDP endpoint/framing path is
  the current bottleneck — the next optimization target after anytls-sb.
- **anytls UoT**: three-way tie at ~1.1–1.5 Gbps.
- Echo RTTs are sub-millisecond for every engine/protocol; nothing here
  is latency-bound.

### Reading the table

- **Bandwidth**: honk leads or ties everywhere. hy2 5239 (+75% vs dae,
  +79% vs sing-box), tuic 5351 (+36% / +90%), trojan and ss2022 at line
  rate with dae and sing-box, anytls-go 9272 (three-way tie). The one
  remaining gap is anytls against the sing-box server: honk 4954 vs dae
  9155 / sing-box 5996. ss2022 got to line rate via the BoringSSL AEAD
  swap: RustCrypto's aes-gcm measured 0.4–0.5 GB/s (AES-NI path not
  engaged) vs BoringSSL's 3.3–6.7 GB/s (`benches/ss_aead.rs`), and the
  swap took the row from 5339 Mbps / 1.01 cores to 9388 / 0.37 — now
  also ahead of dae on CPU (0.37 vs 0.49).
- **CPU per Gbps**: honk is the most efficient engine on every line-rate
  row — trojan 0.42 cores (dae 0.66, sing-box 0.78), ss2022 0.37 (dae
  0.49, sing-box 1.19). QUIC protocols cost honk ~1.06 cores at
  5.2+ Gbps; dae/sing-box need 0.75–0.88 for 2.8–3.9 Gbps.
- **Latency**: TUIC remains the extreme case — 3.8 ms hot vs dae's 79.7 ms
  (honk resumes TLS 1.3 sessions from a process-wide ticket cache; dae
  pays a full QUIC handshake per connection; cold tells the same story,
  2.4 vs 85.2 ms). Other rows are within a few ms both ways.
- **Memory**: honk's musl build uses mimalloc, which retains freed arenas
  — RSS 49–66 MB, at parity with dae (52–64 MB). The trade is deliberate:
  mimalloc buys ~+50% QUIC throughput over musl's stock malloc (5096 vs
  3037 Mbps A/B) for ~40 MB of retained memory.

### Earlier results (software-crypto lab, pre-AES-NI)

Before the engine VM got a host-passthrough CPU, QUIC numbers were
software-crypto-bound for both engines: honk hy2/tuic 2289/2383 Mbps vs
dae(kdae) 2511/2669, with honk's BoringSSL stuck on `nohw` C ChaCha20
(34% of engine CPU). Those rows are superseded by the table above. The
QUIC socket-buffer fix (8 MiB SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF + rmem_max/wmem_max at
16 MiB) and the 8/32 MiB receive-window defaults predate both tables and
apply to both.

## DNS micro-benchmarks (criterion)

`cargo bench -p honk-core --bench dns` — loopback, no external network.
Latest run (2026-07-30, x86_64):

| benchmark | mean |
| --- | --- |
| endpoint parse (udp/dot/doh/doq/h3) | 70–97 ns |
| cache get (hit) | 60 ns |
| cache put | 133 ns |
| cache mixed 90% read / 10% write | 32 ns |
| routing match (per-query rule eval) | 29–79 ns |
| force/restore txid | 1.4 ns |
| build A query | 114 ns |
| forwarder resolve (cache hit) | 283 ns |
| TCP pool exchange (reused conn) | 18 µs |
| UDP upstream exchange | 19 µs |
| length-prefixed framing (duplex) | 6 µs |

Per-query total (routing + cache-hit) is well under 1 µs; upstream
exchanges are loopback-RTT-bound as expected. The bench suite lives in
`crates/honk-core/benches/dns.rs`; mock servers run nodelay — without it
Nagle + delayed-ACK adds ~40 ms per TCP exchange and the numbers measure
the OS, not the code.

`cargo bench -p honk-outbound --bench ss_aead` compares AEAD backends on
Shadowsocks-sized chunks (RustCrypto aes-gcm 0.4–0.5 GB/s vs BoringSSL
AeadCtx 3.3–6.7 GB/s on AES-NI hardware — the reason the SS data path
uses BoringSSL).

## Candidate UDP micro-benchmarks (absolute, not A/B)

The UDP Criterion suite records absolute candidate behavior only. Its fixed
invocation is:

```bash
cd /root/code/honk-feat-udp-to-1
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/root/code/honk/target cargo bench -p honk-core --bench udp -- --save-baseline udp-candidate
```

| Case | Fixed work |
| --- | --- |
| steady enqueue | 1,000,000 128-byte `fast_path_enqueue` calls on a Ready flow, immediately drained to hold steady state |
| reserve / rollback | 10,000 endpoint reservations followed by rollback |
| histogram | 1,000,000 record/snapshot operations |
| queue saturation | 64 admitted datagrams followed by one dropped newest datagram |

Record the candidate's Criterion mean, median, MAD, and absolute throughput.
`udp-candidate` is a repeat-run label, not a comparison to `be587b1`: that
revision has no source-level equivalent interface for a valid A/B. Criterion
also does not provide a merge-gate p95 estimate; do not infer one from this
suite.

## Deployment UDP A/B gate

`bench/udp-latency.sh` is the real deployment driver, not a CI substitute. It
requires the same TPROXY topology and real upstreams for both binaries. Its
fixed invocation is:

```bash
sudo bench/udp-latency.sh \
  --baseline-bin /opt/honk/be587b1/honk-core \
  --candidate-bin /opt/honk/udp-to-1/honk-core \
  --config /etc/honk/bench.dae \
  --echo-target 10.0.2.2:9000 \
  --dns-target 10.0.2.2:53 \
  --samples 10000 --runs 5 --offered-rate 5000
```

The fixed command deliberately has no timeout or hook flags. Configure root's
`HONK_UDP_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default `30`) and
`HONK_UDP_{START,READY,SETUP,PROBE,STATS,TEARDOWN,TOPOLOGY}_HOOK` values; CLI
flags override those values. With `sudo`, use `--preserve-env` for these
variables or configure them in root's environment. The driver supplies no
built-in topology: missing live hooks fail closed.

Every executable hook is run through `env`, not evaluated as a shell snippet.
It receives `variant`, `case`, `run`, `workdir`, `pid`, `pgid`, `selected_bin`,
`baseline_bin`, `candidate_bin`, `config`, `echo_target`, `dns_target`,
`samples`, `offered_rate`, and `timeout`; `pid`/`pgid` are empty for `start`
and `topology`. `start` must finish synchronous setup and then `exec
"$selected_bin" ...`; the driver attests the selected file's device/inode
against `/proc/$pid/exe` and rechecks the same PID/session/start-time/executable
after ready, setup, probe, and stats. A row is emitted only after teardown and
bounded verification that the owned process group is absent; residual descendants
fail the run closed. The legacy positional arguments remain compatible. Targets
may be IPv4, `[IPv6]`, or legal hostnames with a port.
`probe` must report `sent == samples`.

It emits one JSONL object per case/run with exactly these top-level fields:
`schema_version`, `variant`, `commit`, `binary_sha256`, `kernel`, `topology`,
`case`, `run`, `samples`, `offered_rate`, `sent`, `received`, `latency_unit`,
`p50`, `p95`, `p99`, `max`, `loss`, `cpu_pct`, `rss_kib`, `fd_count`,
`queue_drops`, and `warm_hit`. `schema_version` is `1`; latency quantiles are
in microseconds, `loss` is the sample loss ratio, `cpu_pct` is process CPU
usage, `rss_kib` is resident memory in KiB, and `fd_count` is the open
file-descriptor count. The fixed cases are `cold_endpoint`, `steady_hit`,
`warm_session_cold_endpoint`, `dns_hit`, `dns_miss`, `healthy_candidate`, and
`blackholed_candidate`. The driver interface and JSONL shape are checked with
`bash bench/tests/udp-latency-cli.sh`.

The deployment gate compares five 10,000-sample runs at the same topology and
offered rate: healthy cold p50/p95 regression must be at most 5%; a blackholed
first candidate must improve p95 by at least 20% and p99 by at least 30%; a
steady path must keep p99 at most 250 microseconds and zero drops below 70% of
target throughput; AnyTLS warm hits must reach 80% and reduce first reply by
one RTT or at least 20%; steady CPU and p50 regression must be at most 5%; and
IPv4/IPv6 client-observed reply tuples must remain unchanged. **This local
worktree has not run the deployment gate, so it makes no network-latency gate
claim.**

## Release profile and allocator matrix

`bench/release-matrix.sh` compares the explicit `release-size`,
`release-size-thin`, `release-speed`, and `release-speed-thin` profiles against
three allocator arms: mimalloc with collection disabled, mimalloc with the
60-second collector, and the system allocator. Every cell uses isolated Cargo,
workload-cache, and run directories and emits machine metadata plus JSONL/CSV
build and performance records.

Validate all four supported target configurations without compiling:

```bash
bench/release-matrix.sh --all-targets --dry-run --output /tmp/honk-release-matrix
```

A measured host run requires an executable `--benchmark-hook`; the hook contract
and required RSS/PSS/fault/CPU/throughput/latency fields are printed by
`bench/release-matrix.sh --help`. Pin every CPU policy to one governor and keep
turbo in one state for the full matrix; `machine.json` records both settings.
Compare cells only on the same machine and workload. The matrix records
evidence; it does not select a new shipping profile without deployment
throughput and tail-latency results.

Promotion is gated, not inferred from binary size alone. Against the
`release-size` baseline, a candidate must keep every measured throughput
regression within 3%, every p99 latency regression within 5%, and RSS growth
within 20% over five paired runs on the same lab. The size profile remains the
shipping default until all three gates pass.

One preliminary paired deployment run on 2026-08-02 compared
`release-size` and `release-speed` for x86_64 musl with mimalloc and the
60-second collector. Each protocol used three 8-second reverse-throughput runs;
the tail check used 200 requests after warm-up.

| profile | binary | direct | hy2 | tuic | max RSS | hy2 p99 | tuic p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| release-size | 19.50 MB | 9.407 Gbps | 2.756 Gbps | 4.253 Gbps | 56 MB | 5.426 ms | 4.705 ms |
| release-speed | 24.79 MB | 9.388 Gbps | 3.314 Gbps | 5.152 Gbps | 59 MB | 3.409 ms | 3.136 ms |

The speed profile had no throughput or p99 regression and increased maximum
RSS by 5.4%, so this sample passes the numerical gates. It is not a promotion:
one paired run is below the five-run evidence requirement, and its binary is
27.2% larger. `release-size` therefore remains the default.

## Production notes (10.10.10.1 gateway)

- TCP (google/baidu/cloudflare) and HTTP/3 (cloudflare) pass after each
  deploy; gateway logs clean.
- HTTP/3 stall bursts (first bytes fast, body pauses ~14s) appear in
  multi-minute waves tied to the subscription's UDP line quality, not to
  engine builds — A/B deploys of consecutive builds flip both ways within
  the same hour. Client qlog shows ~12% of datagrams declared-lost-then-late
  (latency artifact, not kernel/socket drops).
- 60-min canaries after each deploy sample FDs / established / CLOSE-WAIT /
  warn-rate; the Ready-pool metrics (`/stats` → `pool`: hits, misses,
  entries) are checked on the same cadence.

## Regression gates

- `just outbound-ci` — fmt, clippy, honk-config + honk-outbound suites.
- `just clash-ci` — fmt, clippy, clash_api_test + integration_test.
- `just dns-ci` — DNS subsystem gate.
- `cargo bench -p honk-core --bench dns` — DNS micro-benchmarks (above).
- `cargo bench -p honk-core --bench udp -- --save-baseline udp-candidate` — candidate-only absolute UDP measurements; not a historical A/B or p95 merge gate.
- `bash bench/tests/udp-latency-cli.sh` — deployment-driver CLI/JSONL fixture; the real UDP A/B gate above still requires TPROXY and upstreams.
- `bash bench/tests/runtime-memory-cli.sh` — paired runtime-memory driver CLI, ordering, identity, and fail-closed JSONL fixture.
- Release CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — workspace test gate +
  four-target build (x86_64/aarch64 × gnu/musl) + BTF check + tarballs.
