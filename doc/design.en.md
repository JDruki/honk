# honk Design Document

> Inspired by [dae](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae) (eBPF transparent proxy datapath) and [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box) (outbound groups, protocols, Clash API).
>
> This document describes architecture as implemented in the current tree. Prefer source + this doc over older notes in `plan.md` when they disagree.

## 1. Goals

- Provide a **Linux eBPF transparent proxy** that intercepts LAN/WAN traffic with low overhead.
- Keep a **dae-compatible configuration surface**: the native `.dae` syntax is the primary (and only documented) configuration format.
- Offer a **sing-box-like outbound stack**: multi-protocol handlers, Selector / URLTest / LoadBalance / Fallback groups, health checks, Clash-compatible control API.
- Ship as an **engine-only** binary (`honk-core`). The GraphQL API and Leptos dashboard crates were removed.

## 2. Non-goals (current)

- Full Clash Meta / mihomo feature parity (FakeIP engine and remote rule-sets).
- Windows / macOS transparent proxy.

### Packet walk (simplified)

1. **TC ingress** on each `lan_interface` classifies forwarded client traffic; independently, **TC egress** on each `wan_interface` classifies host-originated TCP/UDP. Omitting `lan_interface` installs only the WAN path. An unresolved `auto` entry remains unattached and fail-open; rtnetlink link/address/route events re-resolve it and install the correct dual- or single-homed program pair without a restart, republish the generated gateway-address `direct(must)` rules through the runtime configuration pipeline, and immediately re-probe outbounds whose health backoff may reflect the old network state.
2. DNS to port 53 takes a **fast path** (skip expensive match loop) and is redirected to the control plane.
3. Outcomes:
   - `direct + must` → leave on host stack (no redirect), in every mode.
   - `direct` without must → also left on the host stack when the per-flow offload decision allows it (cached in `RoutingMeta` bit 57 at route time): in clash `Rule` mode (or with the clash API disabled) when no SNI re-evaluation can change the decision — `dial_mode: ip`, no domain-class rule in the config, or the flow's domain was DNS-learned and evaluated through `DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP`; in clash `Direct` mode unconditionally (the userspace override would force `direct` anyway). In `Global` mode — and in `Rule` mode when a domain re-route may still apply — it redirects into `dae0`.
   - user outbound / block / control-plane routing → redirect into `dae0` when the outbound is considered alive. (In clash `Direct` mode a non-`must` user-outbound flow is instead passed through as direct — same offload as above.)
4. In **daens**, `sk_lookup` assigns the flow to transparent TCP/UDP listeners.
5. **Userspace** takes the routing handoff, optionally sniffs domain, falls back to the full `Router`, applies Clash mode override, selects a group leaf, dials, and relays.
6. Dial/probe/DNS-upstream sockets use **`DAE_BYPASS_MARK` (`0x100`)** so eBPF does not re-proxy control-plane traffic.
7. UDP replies use per-endpoint **anyfrom** transparent sockets (dae parity) so source addresses stay correct on the way back through `dae0_ingress`.

Startup admission is fail-open until the listener generation is complete: TC hooks
leave traffic untouched while `DATAPATH_STATE_MAP[0]` is zero. Userspace publishes
every TCP/UDP listener FD, starts the receive loops, then opens that single gate;
shutdown closes it before listener teardown. A partial SockMap publication can
therefore never redirect a flow into a missing listener slot.

> **Note:** Older docs mentioned host `iptables TPROXY` on the bridge master as the primary path. The live path is **TC redirect + daens + sk_lookup**. Listeners are still `IP_TRANSPARENT`. Cleanup scripts may still remove leftover legacy iptables rules.

## 6. eBPF design

### Programs

| Program family | Hook | Role |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ |
| `lan_ingress_l2/l3` | TC ingress LAN | Classify, route, redirect, TX stats |
| `wan_ingress_l2/l3` | TC ingress WAN | WAN-side / reverse path (dual-homed) |
| `tproxy_lan/wan_egress_*` | TC egress | Local-originated traffic + reverse conn state |
| `dae0_ingress` | TC ingress dae0 | Reply rewrite + RX stats |
| `dae0peer_ingress` | TC ingress dae0peer | Delivery assist in daens |
| `tproxy_sk_lookup` | sk_lookup | Map flows onto listeners |
| cgroup sock/connect/sendmsg | cgroup | Cookie → pid/comm for `pname` rules |

### Key maps

| Map | Role |
| ----- | ------ |
| `ROUTING_MAP` + `ROUTING_META_MAP` + `ROUTING_GROUP_META_MAP` | Double-buffered MatchSet banks + introspection bitmaps + one packed count/bitmap entry per flow group; selector-last publish |
| `DEST/SOURCE/MAC_LPM_ROUTING_MAP` | LPM tries for CIDR/MAC |
| `DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP` | IP → domain-rule bitmaps (DNS-learned) |
| `ROUTING_HANDOFF_MAP` | Tuple → userspace handoff |
| `REDIRECT_TRACK` / `CONN_STATE_MAP` | Redirect + conntrack state |
| `BPF_STATS_MAP` | Conn-state overflow plus redirect/handoff/cookie insert failures |
| `OUTBOUND_CONNECTIVITY_MAP` | Alive bits pushed from userspace health checks |
| `OUTBOUND_STATS` | Per-CPU tx/rx packets/bytes per outbound |
| `LISTEN_SOCKET_MAP` | SockMap of transparent listeners |
| `DATAPATH_STATE_MAP` | Admission gate opened only after the complete listener generation is published |
| `DATAPATH_FLAGS_MAP` | Runtime flags written by userspace: the mode-based direct-offload policy (`DATAPATH_FLAG_OFFLOAD_RULE_DIRECT` / `_ALL` / `_NO_DOMAIN_RULES`), read once per new flow at route time; the decision is cached per flow in `RoutingMeta` bit 57 |
| `EVENT_RINGBUF` | Overflow events drained to tracing |

### Reserved outbound indices

Aligned with dae-core:

```text
0 Direct | 1 Block | 2+ user groups
0xFC MustRules | 0xFD ControlPlaneRouting | 0xFE OR | 0xFF AND
```

### Domain routing split brain

- **At SYN time**, pure domain rules often cannot match without a prior DNS learn or userspace sniff.
- DNS answers update `DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP` so subsequent TCP can match in eBPF.
- `direct` without `must` reaches userspace only when the mode policy says so — always in `Global` mode, and in `Rule` mode when an SNI re-route may still apply (domain-class rules exist, `dial_mode` sniffs, and the flow's domain was not DNS-learned). Otherwise it is offloaded in the kernel exactly like `must` direct (Go dae parity): no userspace relay, no `/connections` entry, and no SNI-based re-route; tx stats are still counted at `lan_ingress`. In `Direct` mode every non-`must`/non-`block` flow is offloaded (the override would force `direct` regardless). The decision is made once per flow at route time and cached in the flow's `RoutingMeta` (bit 57) — the policy word itself (`DATAPATH_FLAGS_MAP`) is written on startup (cachedb-restored mode), on every PATCH `/configs` mode switch, and re-asserted after each reload, and binds at flow creation only.
- (**Experimental, OFF by default** — enable with `HONK_UDP_POST_DECISION_OFFLOAD=1`.) UDP flows whose first datagram is a confirmed QUIC Initial (SNI extracted, or at least a valid decrypted Initial) can additionally be offloaded **after** the userspace decision fully converges to `direct`, via *drop-and-reinject*: the control plane rewrites the flow's published conn_state meta in place (`RoutingMeta::set_offloaded_direct`: outbound normalized to `Direct`, tproxy mark cleared, bit 57 set) and drops the in-flight Initial (with any queued followers) **without relaying a single packet**. QUIC clients must retransmit a lost Initial (RFC 9000), so the retransmission arrives on the `lan_ingress` established-UDP path and passes straight through — the server-visible 5-tuple is the client's own from the first server-seen packet, and the only cost is one Initial RTO at flow setup. Non-QUIC UDP has no retransmission guarantee, so it is never dropped or offloaded here and keeps the full userspace relay; proxied decisions and port 53 are likewise never offloaded, and `Global` mode keeps every non-`must` flow in userspace (`Rule`/clash-API-disabled offload a converged `direct`, `Direct` normalizes every non-`must`/non-`block` decision to `direct` — same semantics as the route-time policy). The branch runs before any dial, so an offloaded flow gets no endpoint, no `/connections` entry, and no stats connection — nothing userspace-side is left behind; its rx bytes are not counted (rx is accounted at `dae0_ingress`), exactly like `must`-direct. After 120s of silence the conn_state is swept and the next Initial simply repeats the decide-drop-reinject cycle. The per-flow bit binds at decision time, so flows created before a reload or mode switch keep their cached decision. When the sniffed domain drove the decision, the offload additionally writes the matched domain rule's bitmap back into `DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP` for the destination IP (same map and lifecycle as DNS-learned routes: it survives conn_state sweeps and follows the existing reload rebuild), so once the conn_state is swept, a mid-session packet — not an Initial, no longer sniffable — is re-decided `DomainKnown → direct` and offloaded at route time with zero loss and zero userspace round-trips; without the writeback the IP-only re-decision could flip the flow to a proxy mid-session. The writeback is best-effort (a failure only forfeits the fast re-decision, never the flow) and happens only for flows that were actually offloaded: for a userspace-relayed flow a post-sweep kernel offload would switch the server-visible tuple. The offload is committed via the lease's `commit_offloaded` handoff (a `KernelOffloadHandoff` removal reason — the endpoint-removal worker deletes conn_states only for `UserspaceEndpointRetired`), so the just-published offload bit is never unwound by reservation teardown. A ClientHello fragmented across CRYPTO frames is completed from the follower queue first (bounded: 8 packets / 250 ms); a still-unresolved flow is dropped unresolved (confirmed QUIC retransmits; the sniffer session keeps the fragments) rather than decided on an IP-only guess that could bypass a domain rule. Measured cost: one Initial PTO per offloaded flow — ~136 ms at a 50 ms initial RTT (≈2–3× RTT), paid once at flow setup; established flows are unaffected. Coverage caveat: only a decision that matched a domain rule has a bitmap to write back — fallback-direct, IP/CIDR-rule direct, and negated-domain-rule directs get no `DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP` entry, so their post-sweep mid-session packets re-enter userspace and are relayed (QUIC connection migration absorbs the tuple change; a per-tuple kernel decision cache was considered and rejected as kernel-ABI cost disproportionate to this 120s-idle edge case).
- TCP SNI/HTTP Host and QUIC Initial SNI both re-run the userspace Router for non-`must`, non-`block` handoffs in domain-aware modes.

## 7. Userspace control plane

`honk-core` owns:

| Subsystem | Responsibility |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Netns / veth setup | Create `daens`, `dae0`/`dae0peer`, addresses, policy routing |
| `EbpfBackend` | Load/attach programs, push maps, stats, mock backend for tests |
| Accept loop | Transparent TCP/UDP, original destination, handoff take |
| `Router` | Full condition set (domain/geoip/geosite/process/…) |
| Sniffing | TCP SNI/Host, QUIC SNI |
| DNS | Cache, routing, forwarder, optional SQLite persist |
| Groups / dial | Via `honk-outbound` |
| Relay | `splice(2)` zero-copy when both ends are plain TCP; else `copy_bidirectional`; PacketTransport-backed UDP endpoint drivers |
| Clash API | Optional axum server |
| Cache DB | Selector choices, mode, optional DNS answers |
| Subscriptions | Fetch + periodic merge without rewriting the config file |

Plain-TCP splice requests at most 64 KiB for each direction's private
nonblocking pipe (128 KiB and four pipe FDs per full-duplex relay). Unsupported
splice paths fall back losslessly before moving bytes.


### Dial modes (`global.dial_mode`)

| Mode | Behavior |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `ip` | Resolve locally; dial by IP; sniffing off |
| `domain` | Sniff domain; verify it resolves to dest IP; dial with domain |
| `domain+` | Like `domain` but skip reality check of sniffed name |
| `domain++` | Force sniff and re-route on sniffed domain |

### UDP endpoint pipeline

**Destination provenance is fail-closed.** The shared IPv4/IPv6 receiver uses a valid
`ORIGDST` control message as authoritative. If it has no `ORIGDST`, only an exact
DNS query plus a specified `PKTINFO` destination may form `IP:53`; otherwise it
may use only a non-wildcard local bind. Malformed, duplicate, truncated, or
unspecified `ORIGDST`/`PKTINFO` metadata is rejected rather than downgraded, and
a packet without provenance is dropped before it can reserve an endpoint or send.

**`PacketTransport` is the only UDP contract.** `PacketOutbound::dial_udp_transport`
returns a framed, bidirectional transport for each endpoint. Tunnel handlers frame
packets directly on their tunnel. A SOCKS5 transport keeps its TCP UDP-ASSOCIATE
control stream for the association lifetime, frames and parses RFC 1928 UDP
packets, and treats control EOF as endpoint failure. Its connected UDP socket uses
the physical `BND.ADDR` relay, while `relay_addr()` and the received peer exposed
to the endpoint are the logical target peer used by first-reply filtering.

**Endpoint creation is transactional.** A `(client, original-destination)` mapping
first publishes an `Initializing` generation with a lease. After route/selection
preparation has one final eligible transport and an anyfrom reply socket, the
driver reaches its ready barrier, the lease commits `Ready`, the retained first
packet is sent and acknowledged, and only then do FIFO followers run. The receive
loop only routes/reserves/enqueues; it never awaits transport I/O. The dedicated
driver owns the first send, follower sends, and replies. A first or steady send has
a five-second timeout; a timeout or error is ambiguous, so the packet is never
replayed through another candidate.

**Queue and process budgets are ownership bounds.** A flow retains at most 64
datagrams, including the first, and all flows together retain at most 8 MiB of
payload. Slow admission and flow/global permits are acquired before payload
allocation or copy; followers are FIFO and nonblocking saturation drops the
newest packet. One startup `RLIMIT_NOFILE` snapshot, capped at 16,384, is split
with saturating arithmetic among a fixed/runtime reserve, active TCP flows (six
descriptors each: accepted socket, outbound socket, and two splice pipe pairs),
retained TCP pool entries, transient proxied dials, and UDP endpoints (three
descriptors each, covering SOCKS5's UDP relay, TCP control stream, and anyfrom
reply socket). TCP, cold non-DNS UDP, and port-53 admission, the TCP pool,
runtime dial semaphore, and UDP endpoint slots all derive from that immutable
partition. At the 16,384 cap the respective capacities are 256 reserved
descriptors, 672 TCP flows, 2,016 pooled TCP entries, 1,008 transient dials,
and 3,024 UDP endpoints; UDP and DNS slow paths are each capped at 256. Removal
notifications use a bounded queue with deduplicated compensation. Reload
cancellation is epoch- and generation-fenced: it drains `Initializing` leases
and their resources, preserves already-`Ready` endpoints, and removes only the
same generation so an older task cannot erase a replacement.
Group ordinals also share eBPF connectivity slots. Reload first makes all transition
slots fail-open, switches the routing generation, then publishes the exact per-group,
per-network alive snapshot so reordered groups cannot inherit stale health.

**Selection races are deliberately narrow.** Normal selector, load-balance,
fallback, explicit-node, and warm-URLTest plans are authoritative single-leaf
plans. Only a top-level cold URLTest plan may prepare several eligible leaves:
absolute starts are 0/30/80 ms and then every 80 ms, with at most three in flight.
LoadBalance cursors and Fallback pins are independent for TCP and UDP, so traffic on
one network cannot advance or repin the other network's authoritative choice.
The first still-eligible success wins; started losers are aborted and drained before
binding. Only an observed preparation error affects traffic health; cancelled or
successfully drained speculative losers are health-neutral. AnyTLS uses a caller-owned,
cap-counted provisional session slot on this path rather than its normal pool-owned
dial task. A loser closes its detached session synchronously; only the finalized winner
commits into the captured runtime-generation pool and starts that pool's janitor, before
any endpoint publication or application send.

**UDP warm-up is opt-in and generation-owned.** `global.udp_warm_node_count`
defaults to 0, which creates no coordinator work or warm metrics. With a positive
budget, discovery peeks authoritative DataUdp group plans in V4 then V6 order,
UUID-deduplicates eligible configured leaves, and applies the budget; direct,
block, and cold URLTest plans are excluded. Dispatch has a maximum of four tasks.
AnyTLS owns the reusable pool in its runtime generation. Reload makes the old
generation terminal to new warm/speculative work, but existing TCP streams and Ready
UDP endpoints keep their sessions; after the old DNS runtime's leases and transports
retire, its pools reject new opens and close each session only when its last stream
releases. Only `Ready` and `AlreadyReady` are warm successes. Direct, other non-AnyTLS, and
currently deferred QUIC warm-up return `NotApplicable`, not a false success.

## 8. Outbound stack

### Handlers (`honk-outbound`)

Registered protocols: Direct, Block, SOCKS5, Shadowsocks (+ 2022), Trojan, VMess, VLESS, Hysteria2, TUIC, Juicity, AnyTLS.

Shared layers:

- `transport.rs` — TCP → optional TLS → WS / gRPC; a node with REALITY parameters takes the REALITY handshake here instead of plain TLS
- `quic.rs` — shared quinn client for Hy2 / TUIC / Juicity
- `tls.rs` — BoringSSL TLS and Chrome-fingerprint helpers
- `reality.rs` — REALITY client handshake (see below)

VMess and VLESS are compiled behind honk-outbound's `rprx` cargo feature (on in honk-core's default build); without it those nodes parse but dials are refused with "No handler for protocol".

### REALITY client

`honk-outbound/src/reality.rs` implements the REALITY handshake for VLESS/VMess outbounds, byte-compatible with Xray-core `transport/internet/reality/reality.go`, over two client hooks carried by a small boring-sys fork patch (`SSL_set1_client_x25519_private_key` presets the ephemeral X25519 key into the ClientHello key_share; `SSL_set_client_hello_fixup_cb` allows rewriting the serialized ClientHello in place before it enters the transcript):

- The legacy session_id is rewritten to `AES-256-GCM(authKey).Seal([ver:3][0][timestamp:4][short_id:8])`, where `authKey = HKDF-SHA256(X25519(client ephemeral, server public key), salt = client_random[:20], "REALITY")`, the nonce is `client_random[20:32]`, and the AAD is the whole ClientHello with the session_id slot zeroed.
- Server authentication replaces PKI (the mask target's real certificate would always fail it): a genuine REALITY server presents an ephemeral ed25519 certificate whose signature equals `HMAC-SHA512(authKey, raw ed25519 public key)`. Anything else — a real certificate relayed from the mask target when the session_id did not decrypt, a wrong key, a MITM — is fail-closed.
- Chrome mode is aligned against a real Chrome ClientHello: the reality-mode JA4 is `t13d1516h2_8daaf6152771_01adaf6b9c20` with ja4_a/ja4_b identical to real Chrome; the one known difference is ja4_c, because the signature-algorithm list must be widened with ed25519 (BoringSSL otherwise rejects the REALITY ephemeral leaf with WRONG_SIGNATURE_TYPE before authentication can run). ALPS is pinned to the old `0x4469` codepoint, closer to real Chrome than uTLS. Session resumption is never offered.
- The REALITY `dest`/SNI target must serve a TLS Certificate message under 8 KiB (sing-box reality buffers 8192 bytes): `dl.google.com` works, `www.microsoft.com` (8273 B) does not.

With `flow: xtls-rprx-vision`, the VLESS request carries the flow in the Xray `encoding.Addons` protobuf; the response header is stripped lazily on the first read (servers piggyback it on the first downstream bytes), and Vision response frames (`[command][contentLen u16][paddingLen u16]`) are unpadded on the read side — `command=2` (XTLS direct copy) switches the read side to the raw TCP socket when the server abandons the outer TLS session, while the write side stays on the outer stream.

### Groups

Policies (sing-box shaped):

| Policy | Behavior |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Selector** | Manual pin; Clash API + cache persistence |
| **URLTest** | Lowest latency + tolerance vs the incumbent's current measured latency (sing-box parity); separate TCP/UDP selections; idle sleep; dial failure clears the node's latency history so the next connection re-selects; optional per-group `check_url` probed and ranked independently of the global target. Only an unmeasured top-level UDP URLTest plan is a staggered multi-candidate preparation; a warm selection is authoritative. |
| **LoadBalance** | Per-group round-robin among alive members |
| **Fallback** | First alive in declaration order; sticky until death |

Nested groups (`groups` field) flatten recursively (depth ≤ 8) to a single leaf on the dial path.

### Health (`AliveDialerSet`)

- Per-node states: TCP / DnsUDP / DataUDP × v4/v6
- Concurrent probes (default batch 10), recovery hysteresis, grace period, and 5s→300s exponential backoff; a separate `min(5s, check_interval)` scheduler considers only due dead TCP/UDP families, so a long normal interval cannot lock out recovery (deep-backoff nodes still probe only at max-cooldown)
- TCP: HTTP HEAD or raw connect; UDP: DNS query through the node’s own `dial_udp_transport`
- Pushes connectivity into eBPF so dead outbounds are not redirected

## 9. DNS design

```text
Client :53 → eBPF DNS fast path (redirect, no full route loop)
          → DnsController → cache → DnsRouter → UpstreamPool
          → answer + optional DOMAIN_ROUTING_MAP update
          → anyfrom reply
```

- Userspace cache only today (no kernel DNS answer cache map yet).
- Upstream protocols: UDP/TCP/DoT/DoH/DoQ/DoH3 are all implemented (`honk-core/src/dns/transport/`, pooled sessions with one retry after invalidation).
- Optional `outbound` on an upstream routes queries through a proxy node/group (anti-pollution intent; UDP+proxy is intentionally carried as TCP-DNS by the upstream policy; SOCKS5 RFC 1928 UDP remains a complete, independent transport; DoQ/DoH3 are direct-only).

Resolution defaults to `both`: an omitted strategy forwards eligible A and AAAA
queries concurrently. `preferipv4`/`preferipv6` still query both families and
only suppress the non-preferred answer when the preferred family has usable
records; `ipv4only`/`ipv6only` do not forward the ineligible family. Bootstrap
fallback runs once, only when every eligible family is unusable, and its result
is filtered by the same eligibility set.

Cache and singleflight keys include the ingress profile, routing policy, scope,
and operation. Requests that are not cacheable or coalescable bypass both
layers; cancellation releases their flight state. DNS persistence uses an
`HDNS` v2 record under the `dns:v2:` namespace. Writes are bounded and epoch
fenced: a flush discards older queued epochs before writing the newest state,
while stale, corrupt, version-mismatched, or policy-mismatched rows are
skipped on restore. A rollback to a pre-v2 binary therefore ignores v2 rows;
they may remain in `cache.db` and do not change the old runtime's behavior.

Runtime reloads publish a new coherent generation. Each DNS runtime pins the matching
outbound runtime, so existing leases keep the old node configuration and session pools
while new requests use the replacement even across the publication boundary. After old
leases and DNS transports retire, the old outbound pools stop accepting streams and
drain live TCP/UDP flows; process shutdown remains the force-close boundary. Retirement
closes stalled DNS generations at the deadline and caps retained generations. Pooled
transports single-flight initialization and close idle sessions exactly once.
Cache, flight, persistence, runtime, transport, projection, and outcome
diagnostics use independent monotonic atomic counters. An internal scrape
loads each counter without blocking request writers; it is best-effort rather
than one coherent instant, so cross-counter invariants must not be inferred.
Structured failure logs expose only bounded `error_kind` classes
(forwarder, persistence, projection, and transport) plus bounded fields such
as the transport label; they omit query names, upstream addresses, and
free-form error payloads. This adds no public DNS metrics endpoint,
configuration key, or API.

## 10. Clash API

Enabled when `experimental.clash_api.external_controller` is non-empty.

Core surface: `/version`, `/configs`, `/proxies`, delay endpoints, `/rules`, `/connections`, `/traffic`, `/stats`, `/logs`, `/dns/query`, cache flush, `/providers/proxies`, external UI auto-download (Yacd-meta). `GET /stats` includes a stable nested `udp` object; its complete schema is documented in the component reference.

Auth: `Authorization: Bearer` or `?token=` (percent-decoded).

## 11. Runtime privileges

- **root** required for real eBPF: load BPF, TC/cgroup/sk_lookup attach, netns, veth, transparent bind, sysctl.
- Docker: `--privileged --network=host --pid=host` and mount `/sys`.
- Tests use `MockEbpfBackend` / `--mock-ebpf` without privileges.

## 12. Security notes

- Treat config files and BPF objects as **privileged input**.
- Clash API has **no TLS**; bind to localhost or put a reverse proxy in front; set a strong `secret`.
- Bypass mark must stay on control-plane dial sockets or the gateway will loop its own traffic.

## 13. Authorship (design process)

- **eBPF datapath** (`honk-ebpf`, `honk-ebpf-common`, attach/maps path in `honk-core`): primary human design, implementation review, and verification focus of the project maintainer.
- **Remaining subsystems** (config parsers, outbound handlers, groups/health, DNS userspace, Clash API, much of the control-plane glue): largely authored with AI assistance; the maintainer performed **partial code review** rather than line-by-line ownership.
- See the root README for the same disclosure in project overview form.
